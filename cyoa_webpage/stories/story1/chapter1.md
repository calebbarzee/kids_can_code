### Chapter 1: The Awakening

You awaken to the gentle hum of your ship's systems. The cockpit's dim lights flicker as your eyes adjust. It's been years since you set out on this journey to explore the Andromeda sector. The mission was simple: find and establish contact with the lost colony of Robonix-5, a planet rumored to be the hub of advanced robotics technology. But something feels off. Your ship's AI, NOVA, alerts you.

"Commander, we are approaching Robonix-5. Scanners indicate an unknown energy field surrounding the planet. Landing might be dangerous."
