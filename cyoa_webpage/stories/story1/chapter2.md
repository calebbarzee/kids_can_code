### Chapter 2: Descent to Danger

You grip the controls as the ship begins its descent. The energy field crackles around the hull, but you push through. As you break through the atmosphere, the landscape of Robonix-5 unfolds beneath you â€“ a mix of advanced cities and wild, untamed wilderness.

NOVA's voice cuts through the static, "Commander, I've detected several robotic lifeforms approaching our location."
